  abstract={Low vision individuals use their residual vision in their daily life to read text such as price tags, street signs, medicine labels. However, there is no objective tool for evaluating text accessibility for low vision. As modern Optical Character Recognition (OCR) achieves high performance in text recognition, it may be possible to develop “visually impaired” OCR (VI-OCR) to mimic low vision performance and serve as a tool for assessing text visibility. We aim to design a new framework combining OCR and human contrast sensitivity functions (CSF) to simulate the text recognition capability of low vision.}
