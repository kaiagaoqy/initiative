  abstract={Low vision individuals use their residual vision in their daily life to read text such as price tags, street signs, medicine labels. However, there is no objective tool for evaluating text accessibility for low vision. As modern Optical Character Recognition (OCR) achieves high performance in text recognition, it may be possible to develop “visually impaired” OCR (VI-OCR) to mimic low vision performance and serve as a tool for assessing text visibility. We aim to design a new framework combining OCR and human contrast sensitivity functions (CSF) to simulate the text recognition capability of low vision.}

%   author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
%   abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
