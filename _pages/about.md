The visual accessibility of a space refers to the effectiveness with which vision can be used to travel safely and pursue intended activities in the space. Visual accessibility of a space is lower for impaired vision, leading to higher risks of encountering hazardous situations, falling, and being disoriented in navigation. 

Environmental accessibility can be improved by enhancing the visibility of informative or hazardous features through cost-effective modifications of contrast, illumination, and materials. However, it is difficult for people with normal vision, even those with rehab expertise, to judge whether specific objects or features would be visible for individuals with different levels of vision impairment, or to judge the efficacy of modifications. While there is clear guidlines and regulations for enhancing the physical accessibility of spaces, the evaluation of visual accessibility lacks an objective system.

We initiate the Visual Accessibility Data Initiative to bring data-driven and human-centered approaches into developing objective systems for evaluating and enhancing the visual accessibilities of informative and hazardous features in our environments.
