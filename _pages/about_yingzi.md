Yingzi Xiong is the Principal Investigator of the Vision Accessibility Initiative. Dr. Xiongâ€™s research is motivated by the questions of how the human brain 
learns new knowledge, adapts to changes, and rehabilitates after impairments occur. She seeks the answers to these questions in human vision and hearing, from both basic and translational science points of view. Her ongoing projects investigate the interaction of senses in real life activities to develop effective training methods, establish tools for clinical and self-assessment, and increase the accessibility of digital devices and environments
